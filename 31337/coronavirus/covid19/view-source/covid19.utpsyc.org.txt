      <h2>The COVID Social Psychological Survey.</h2>
      <p>The Covid Survey is an online questionnaire that takes about 15 minutes to complete. A series of questions are included that ask about the ways people are thinking about and responding to the current coronavirus outbreak. Individuals who complete the survey will get specific feedback about their coping strategies along with information that might help them deal with the current uncertainties.
        <br/><br/>Although optional, we are also asking participants to provide an email address so that we can contact them sometime later to see how their thoughts and behaviors may be changing. Except for the optional email, no other identifying information is collected.</p>
