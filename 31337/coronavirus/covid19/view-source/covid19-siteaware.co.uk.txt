                        <p>Firstly please take the time to read this page in full to make sure you understand everything fully.</p>
<p>TCG have created this page to help you decide if you are able to work, report site issues if you see any and communicate absence if you feel ill.</p>
<p>The information collated will only be used to protect and communicate quickly any issues that arise helping to keep you save, so please again read the below information and complete the info at the bottom off the page.</p>
<p>This site is aimed at <strong><u>site workers</u></strong> only.</p>
<p><strong>Background&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are likely to have seen the ongoing media coverage of the recent outbreak of coronavirus, which originated in Hubei province in China. More recently, cases have been confirmed in various locations across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation continues to change quickly and as a project, there is a risk that it could impact our workforce and operations. It is important that we are all taking appropriate preventative actions to ensure that we remain safe and well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK Chief Medical Officers have raised the risk to the public from low to moderate, but the risk to individuals remains low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>General Guidance&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If you feel you are suffering from symptoms that could be coronavirus, please first contact your local health advisory service. The quickest access to advice is by calling the NHS advice line on 111.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The symptoms of coronavirus are:&nbsp; </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A cough</li>
<li>A high temperature</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
<p>But these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about the symptoms can be found on the NHS website&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Coronavirus is spread&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Because it is a new illness, we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><u>There are things you can do to help stop viruses like coronavirus spreading:</u></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough or sneeze (not your hands)</li>
<li>Put used tissues in the bin immediately</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water often &ndash; use the hand sanitiser gels <br />provided around site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell.</li>
<li>Try to limit unnecessary activity&rsquo;s, this might include bring food in from home, travel directly to site and then home</li>
<li>Priorities what&rsquo;s import, and limit social gatherings if unnecessary but if they are, please follow the same site rules, hands washing, no contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do we expect from you?<span style="color: #ff0000;"> (please reiterate this to everyone) &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please wash your hands regularly, and use hand sanitiser stations if provided every time you go through the turnstiles or use the toilets, canteens, kitchens, handrails, table surfaces etc. This will not only protect yourself, but it will help to protect your friends and colleagues from the spread of germs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not spit anywhere on the project. This includes sinks in the welfare facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if you need medical help NHS 111 has on online coronavirus service that can tell you if you need medical help and advise you what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cabling Group are monitoring all government advice websites, including Public Health England and up to date world meters stating current trends and predictions of the Coronavirus.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s essential we remain a team and support each other through this unprecedented time and the most selfless act is to be responsible and sensible and to follow the published guidelines.</p>
<p>This situation is unprecedented and is constantly evolving, we ask all our staff/subcontractors to be <strong>responsible with their health and self-isolate</strong> if you feel unwell, please advise your manager or us the link that will be provided via this site/ email as soon as possible.&nbsp; Ensure you wash your hands regularly and consider reduced travel wherever possible. We have added some information websites below, it is also important to recognise the number of affected cases is extremely low against the population, the risk remains low unless you are over 70 or have an underlying health issue.</p>
<p>Obviously, lots of office-based services have adapted a split shift or work from home policy, which is not practical for site workers.</p>
<p>We will update you with any further measures that we feel we need to take but also please communicate any concerns you have, via the link provided on the confirmation email which will be sent you in due course. &nbsp;</p>
