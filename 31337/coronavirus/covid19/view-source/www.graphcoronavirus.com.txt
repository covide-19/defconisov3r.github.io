                These graphs use the SIR model, which stands for susceptible, infective, and recovered.
                <ol>
                    <li>Susceptible: Those who could become infected</li>
                    <li>Infective: Those who have the disease and can transmit it</li>
                    <li>Recovered: Those who have developed immunity to the disease</li>

            </div>
            <p>
                In this best-case scenario, an infective would infect 2.24 susceptibles on average. This low number is only possible if large events are cancelled and infectives quarantine themselves effectively. Effective quarantining is the best way to extinguish the
                disease and create herd immunity. As seen in the graph, about 50 million people will remain susceptible by the disease in the long run, meaning they will not have been infected by the disease. This scenario also assumes that over 80% of cases are mild, which greatly reduces the recovery time
                and hospital load. If all citizens comply with effective quarantine methods and the government is able to heavily restrict travel and large events, the outbreak could be contained with even better results than what this model currently predicts.

            <p>
                In this expected scenario, an infective would infect 2.91 susceptibles on average. This assumes that not everybody is able to quarantine themselves effectively and a few large events may not be cancelled. Unfortunately, even this small of a change leads
                to 50% decline in the number of people who will not be infected: 50 million to 25 million. The model assumes that approximately 80% of cases are mild, which will result in a larger load for the healthcare system and more fatalities.

            <p>
                In this worst-case scenario, an infective would infect 3.58 susceptibles on average. The model shows what might happen if many people do not properly quarantine themselves and large events are not shut down before it is too late. As shown by the graph,
                the outbreak will still be ongoing after 8 months. This will undoubtedly overwhelm the American healthcare system, and this will result in a large increase in fatality rates and a prolonged recovery period. The number of mild cases would
                be under 80%.

                The United States is currently in the early stages of the outbreak, experiencing an exponential increase in the number of cases. Yesterday, the United States reported 548 new cases, a 25.15% increase that brings the total number of confirmed cases to
                2,727. The President declared a national state of emergency on 3/13, effectively providing more funding to deal with the outbreak. Many schools have already cancelled their classes and moved to an online format. Several large events have
                been cancelled as well, including most sports.

                China reported 26 new cases yesterday, a 0.03% increase that brings their total confirmed cases to 80,826. It is important to note a large increase in cases between days 22 and 23 (2/12-2/13) that resulted from a new diagnosis method. While their medical
                system was quickly overwhelmed at first, China's infrastructure allowed for a quick response, including a new hospital built in just days. Additionally, the government completely shut down Wuhan and put in place national restrictions,
                and this was a hugely successful quarantine effort. Unfortunately, it was at the cost of their economy. This <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/chinese-annual-gdp-growth-could-fall-below-2percent-economist-warns.html">CNBC
                    article</a> estimates that China's year-over-year economic growth could be under 2%, over a 67% decrease from 2019. As China plan reopens many of their businesses and schools in the coming weeks, we may see another increase in the
                number of confirmed cases.

                South Korea reported 107 new cases yesterday, a 1.34% increase that brings their total confirmed cases to 8,086. A large amount of these cases have been traced back to Shincheonji, which is a church in Seoul. In the first two weeks of the South Korean
                outbreak, about 60% of all cases were associated with the church. The government acted fast to shut down the church and is currently investigating the church. Additionally, South Korea quickly scaled the production of coronavirus testing
                kits, which many other countries have not been able to do.

            <p>
                Italy reported 3,497 new cases yesterday, a 19.8% increase that brings their total confirmed cases to 21,157. It is important to note that Italy did not report any new cases between days 50 and 51 (3/11-3/12). This drastically increases the total number
                of cases predicted by the logistic regression model. We adjusted the number of cases according to new data in order to provide a better projection. Both the unadjusted and adjusted curves are shown above. Similar to China, Italy has shut
                down all schools non-essential businesses in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Unfortunately, this quarantine came too late, and Italy's healthcare system is currently overwhelmed. This has resulted in an unusually high mortality rate,
                at 8.16%.
