		<h1>COVID-19 Resources</h1>
		<p>Here are some links, charts, videos, and resources I've compiled over the past few days with important warnings and information.</p>
		<p>I'm not a doctor or a medical professional, but a concerned US citizen looking to inform the public of the dangers that lie ahead if the US and other countries do not start <strong>immediately staying home as much as possible and practicing social distancing when outside</strong>. The single best thing we can do is minimize the amount of the virus that is spreading at any one given time.</p>
		<p>You'll hear a lot that younger and healthier people should not be concerned. They should not be so concerned about the effects it will have on their own bodies; however, if they become infected, <strong>they become vectors that will infect others, including the older and unhealthy population</strong>. Most countries, including the US, simply do not have enough medical professionals, hospital beds, respirators, and protective equipment to serve all that will be affected with the most severe symptoms. There will be overcrowding and tough decisions to be made about who gets care and who does not.</p>

			<p>On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider.</p>
