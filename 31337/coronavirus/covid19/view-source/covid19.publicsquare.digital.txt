<p>The Coronavirus Quiz is an educational tool that seeks to help people tell truth from fiction when it comes to Coronavirus health information. It was created by <a href="https://digitalpublicsquare.org">Digital Public Square,</a> a not-for-profit spun out of the University of Toronto, dedicated to rethinking and redesigning the way technology is used to support communities-in-need. Our goal: Healthy communities enabled by <strong>good</strong> technology. </p>



<p>Our aim with this tool is to increase public knowledge about health safety as it relates to the Coronavirus. All of the content within has been cross checked against trusted sources (e.g. the World Health Organization and Health Canada).

Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don\\u2019t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available.\\\" A report published on March 11, 2020 by U.S. scientists found that in lab-controlled experiments the virus could be detected on cardboard surfaces for up to 24 hours.
