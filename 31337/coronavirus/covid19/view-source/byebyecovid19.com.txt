    <p class="intro">As you know, the Covid-19 has no borders and it has become a reality for all of us. The only way to get rid of this virus is to stand together and work together.</p>
    <p>I am not a health expert, I am not a government or an influencer, but a simple person who wonders how I can help solve this global problem. And do you know what? You and I are the solution to this pandemic.</p>
    <h2>April 1st</h2>
    <p>April 1st is the April Fool's Day. Why not take advantage of this day to create the biggest joke in the history? Let's play with this Covid19! Let's all stay at home <u>during a month</u> and stop this virus from finding us. No matter our religion, nationality and differences, let's all create a movement of international solidarity together. It is the one and only way to increase our chances of eliminating this virus and at the same time to be able to fully enjoy our next summer outside.</p>
